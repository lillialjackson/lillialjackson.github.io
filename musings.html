          <p class="project-content"> I built this site as an introduction to me and my life as a developer. I wanted to show case my various projects,
          but also give a sense for who I am as a person. I have a lot of hobbies and interests that I am very passionate about and happy to share about.
          I have always loved problem solving and challenging myself. Rock climbing and Jiujitsu were an immediate fit for me. They have both mental and physical
         aspects that require patience and determination to succeed. Coding and programming possessed those same qualities which naturally fit my personality and bring
         me a lot of enjoyment. I am always excited to learn new technologies and languages, solve problems, and create. I highly value self improvement, determination,
         and joy. I always strive to learn more, be better, and love what I do.
         <br> This site itself was made in HTML5, CSS3 with Bootstrap, and ES7.

        <li class="project-list-item"> Becoming a Developer
          <p class="project-content">
            I come from what would be considered a "non-traditional" background for web development, though despite how it sounds there seem to be many developers like me working
            in tech. I studied Anthropology and was on track for Medical School through my undergraduate program, and was preparing to go on to P.A. or N.P. school when I decided to
            take a brief sabbatical from academia and travel for a short time. I worked and saved money for about a year, and was soon off on my first adventure abroad.
            <br> I spent 2.5 months volunteering in rural Thailand, working with children with special needs and teaching English. As much as I learned, and enjoyed my experience in volunteering
            there were also flaws I found within the volunteer system, which caused me to think about the flaws back home and what I really wanted out of my life. By the time I returned home, I was certain
            that I did not want to go back to Medical School of any sort. I began dabbling in coding, mentored by my brother-in-law who had been coding since childhood, but also explored the possibilities
            of being a personal trainer, a full-time rock climber, a teacher, and found that none of them really appealed as a profession -- except maybe rock climbing, but let's be honest I am no Alex Puccio.
            <br> In 2016, I had the great fortune of having the opportunity to live in Bogota, Colombia for 3 months and climb all around the country. I climbed, explored, learned, and ended it all with a 2 week
            trek through Chilean Patagonia. I will never forget how amazing this trip was and all I was so lucky to experience. While I was down there, I worked on my first solo-coding project, a teacher site for
            my friend. Upon my return on January 1st, 2017 I was confident that programming was the right choice for me.
            <br> I worked part-time at a bridal shop as a consultant, where I learned a lot about sales and small business practices, and learned coding on my days off. During this time, I learned a lot about fundamental
            computer science concepts and programming, as well as enjoying a month long road trip through Ireland with my sister, brother-in-law and mentor, and my mother.
            <br> On January 1st, 2018 I quit my job at the bridal shop to study web development full time, which was...scary. With a little encouragment and support, I was finally ready to fully invest my time and energy into
            programming. I learned so much over the next 5 months, and continue to learn more all the time. I set up my first servers, and databases, and finished my first full-stack projects. I finally had the time and energy
            to be excited about what I was learning and explore the different possibilities.
            <br> In the future, I hope to continue to improve my coding skills as a web developer, develop my personal projects, work with great teams to develop some awesome professional projects, and try my hand at game development.
            If I can learn anything from the past, I know that list may change and grow as I get further into my programming career, but I am excited everyday by the multitude of possibilities my future holds in Development.

        <li class="project-list-item"> Climbing
          <p class="project-content">
            I started climbing in August of 2014, about a month after I graduated from college. Prior to climbing, I hadn't considered myself much of an athlete for the past four years.
            I had played soccer competitively for years, prior to college, but chose to play more casually for my first year at school while adjusting to the work load.<br>
            My sophomore year I was considering playing again in the Spring, but had the misfortune of breaking two vertebrae in my mid and lower spine that Winter. Recovery was intense and time consuming,
            but overall I was lucky to not need surgery. I was told by my spinal specialist that I would no longer be able to particpate in full contact or high impact activities, including regular running.
            This put returning to the field out of reach for me.
            <br> Recovery took about a year, and after I was so weak and triggered into painful spasms so easily that I figured the time in my life when I considered myself an athlete was now at an end. After two years
            I finally decided to try climbing with the encouragment of some friends. I was thrilled to discover that climbing was static enough, and self-paced enough that I could learn to climb and get stronger. I couldn't
            believe that I had found a sport that I could do and not spend the following week on bed rest. I have climbed at least 3 times a week, every week since.
            <br> I have met amazing friends through the climbing community, and had the great fortune to climb all over the world. I've been able to use climbing to further strengthen my old injury areas and now I participate in
            Brazilian Jiujitsu as well. Recovery is an ongoing process, but climbing has restored a lot of my strength and sense of self.
