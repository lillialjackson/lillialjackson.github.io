      <h2> Projects! </h2>
      <p>Below I have listed a collection of my various projects, click the project title for more information:</p>
    <div class="project-list">
      <ul>
        <li class="project-list-item" > Alpha for Beta
              <p class="project-content"> A webapp for connecting climbers with partners in their area. Made with React, Express, Knex, Postgresql. Fully built out front end and back end.
                This app was my first full stack React project, I learned a lot about coding server and database requests, promises, authentication, and single page applications. I really enjoyed working in React,
                the react framework definitely helped me manage the state of my app with more ease, and helped me keep my code DRY with its reusable components.

                  <button class="project-button" type="button"> Visit Alpha </button>
                </a>
             </p>
          </li>
        <li class="project-list-item"> Lost & Hound
            <p class="project-content"> A site for registering dogs, so lost dogs can be easily reunited with their owners. Made with ES7, Express, Knex, Postgresql. Fully built out front end and back end.
              This was a fun full stack project that I thought of while walking my dog (even though she is too chicken to run off). I wanted practice with DOM events in plain ES7 and with writing server and database
              requests using JS and the Knex library. Knex is a really fun and easy to use library that allows you to write your database queries in JS.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="project-list-item"> Bump Dot Pass
          <p class="project-content"> My first game! A simple tennis-like game built with HTML/CSS and JS. This was part of an intro to game programming course
            that I took online. I love games and I was interested to see what was possible to build in JS with HTML canvas. I had a lot of fun practicing JS, learning
            how to make the HTML canvas interactive, and making a few retro style tile games - part of my Retro Jam game collection.

        </li>
        <li class="project-list-item"> Bump Dot Smash
          <p class="project-content"> Smash all the bricks with the ball, be careful not to drop the ball! Built with HTML and JS. This was part of the same JS game course
            that helped me make Bump Dot Pass. This was a fun variation on the first game. I really enjoyed practicing my JS with such a visual represntation of what I was coding.
            The second game in my Retro Jam game collection.

        </li>
        <li class="project-list-item"> Racer Chaser
          <p class="project-content"> Race a friend! Built in HTML and JS, programmer art made in Photoshop. Please excuse the programmer art... it is good for a solid chuckle at the very least.
            I loved making this game, there was a lot more complexitity and math involved with making this game than there was in the previous two mentioned. I enjoyed learning about using key codes for
            object controls and it really helped me expand my knowledge on classes in JS, since they are relatively new compared to other OOP languages. Racer Chaser is the third game in my Retro Jam game collection.
